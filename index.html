    <h1>The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that catches many people
      out when first encountered. Vos Savant presented a solution that was,
      initially, rejected in the popular media of the day.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Imagine you are on a gameshow! You are presented with three doors, there is a prize behind only one.
        <li>You pick a door, but the host does not open it yet. The host opens a different door to the one you selected.</li>
        <li>The host then asks: Do you want to stick with your original door or switch?</li>
        <li>Your odds are BETTER if you switch!</li>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>WHY?! Because your odds go from a 2/3 chance to 1/3. Don't believe me... play with the demo below.</p>
    <p>
        <div class="container">
            <p>First, mentally pick your door.
                <br />
 <button type="button" class="host">Click here to see what door the host opens</button>
 <br />Do you want to change your mind? Click the door you choose.</p>
    <div class="doors">
      <p id="0">?</p>
      <p id="1">?</p>
      <p id="2">?</p>
    </div>
     <button type="button" class="replay">Replay</button>
</div>
        <p>This program demonstrates that Vos Savant is correct.</p>
