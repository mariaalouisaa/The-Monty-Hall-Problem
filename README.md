# The-Monty-Hall-Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that catches many people out when first encountered. Vos Savant presented a solution that was, initially, rejected in the popular media of the day.

1. Imagine you are on a gameshow! You are presented with three doors, there is a prize behind only one.
2. You pick a door, but the host does not open it yet. The host opens a different door to the one you selected.
3. The host then asks: Do you want to stick with your original door or switch?
4. Your odds are BETTER if you switch!

WHY?! Because your odds go from a 1/3 chance to 2/3. Don't believe me... play with the demo I created in this repo.
